              A question from a girl to the world out there...
            </h2>
            <p style={pstyle}>
              I’m not a feminist neither I am against about the concept of the
              support given to girls for their wellbeing but I’m somewhere in
              between that. I always wonder what is the real value of a girl in
              this society. Is it just treated like other human beings or does
              it have a unique place? From the day a girl is born till the day
              she dies, her existence is doubted. Let’s take a deeper look into
              it. Let’s see where this end and what we can conclude. I’m not
              telling you that after reading this all of them are going to be
              having a similar thought. Some might get offended. Some might even
              feel this was a waste of time. But what’s wrong in trying to know
              instead of not trying at all.
            </p>

            <p style={pstyle}>
              I have noticed some things. Let’s start by the birth. I have seen
              people crying over a birth of a girl. I have also seen people
              hosting a grand party after a girl is born but this doesn’t bother
              me. The thing which bothers me is why do people cry over a birth
              of an angel? Why do they have a remorse for a new life which
              entered into the world? I have got many questions from my
              childhood. BTW let me tell you I was a very curious person. I
              never settled for an answer. I wanted an explanation. Back to the
              topic, I always asked people that are girls born with a curse on
              their family and you will not believe what kind of answers I have
              received. Few said yes. They have to be married by spending all
              the money her parents earn in their lifetime. I was scared. I
              thought we all have got cursed through this. I was exploring for
              more answers. Few said that all girls have to face this problem. I
              was not convinced. I needed an answer…
            </p>

            <p style={pstyle}>
              After I grew up there was another problem that was bigger than
              this. It was the problem when you step into the society. For young
              girls the society is her school. She is always said to follow
              rules. Be the way girls are supposed to be. Do things what girls
              are meant to do. And here I come with questions again. Why can’t
              we do things that are not for girls. Why can’t a girl fly kite on
              Sankranti rather than making rangolis in the porch. Why a girl
              can’t play Holi with her friends instead of making sweets in the
              kitchen. Why can’t a girl do what they wish to? Why are they
              always expected to be stuck to things they are expected to do? I
              know some of you might get to tell that because they are meant to
              do all this. Some might also say that these things are not what a
              boy should do so a girl only have to do this. But I ask why…
            </p>

            <p style={pstyle}>
              Going further into her life. As she becomes a teenager, she is
              expected to seek someone’s protection because you know… society
              isn’t safe for girls. If the society isn’t safe for girls and boys
              are meant to protect it then for whom is the society safe to live
              for? Who is making the society unsafe then?? We are always said to
              wear proper clothes. Speak in a low voice, be aware and careful
              where ever we go. But why? Why only us? Why can’t people teach
              others to be respectful. Her, to be clear I’m not just speaking
              about boys who are dangerous to girls. I’m speaking about every
              person who is not thinking about the well being of other person.
              I’m speaking about the people who have lost the meaning of
              humanity in their lives. Every other day I hear many girls being
              raped and molested in some or the other way. She is treated worse
              than an animal and being left on their own. Some girls lose the
              support which they get from their parents. I ask a question now.
              Why are a greater number of girls being molested? Are they
              vulnerable? Are they not capable of defending themselves? Are they
              so naïve that they don’t understand what is happening with them?
              Answers to all these questions are still not found but I have
              noticed something. Girls who are adjusting, who think they have
              their faith written like this from god are being molested. The
              girls who raise her voice is not that unsafe. But still, if you
              are a girl, the society is unsafe for you…
            </p>

              Then comes a time where girls be in a dream world that her dreams
              would be fulfilled. That she can do what she dreamt of becoming
              one day. But, hey, life isn’t that simple. I know girls have got a
              lot of reservations for her in many sectors. She has got all the
              support. But wait, let me ask you. How many girls are pursuing
              what they wished for? Numbers are low but the dreams which are
              broken are very high. She is restricted with number of reasons
              both from her past and her future. People say past cant be changed
              and future cannot be predicted. Then, why pose restrictions on
              things that can’t be changed or predicted? No answers found. The
              things that are found is broken dreams and adjustments…

              Oh. Our girl is all grown. Time for the most awaited event of her
              life. Her marriage. Its not a lie. I have seen parents spending
              their lifetime money in a marriage. Its funny sometimes. Its like
              you ordering food but the restaurant guy is not charging you
              instead he is giving you a 5-star luxury feeling. A good meal and
              he is paying to you. Didn’t get what I meant… I hope the girls
              understand. I will elaborate. She is getting married; her parents
              do all the things what her in-laws want. They pay money too in the
              form of dowry but what do they get. A loss of child in their
              family and lifetime of void. But still people find the dish that
              was served wrong in the reception. They complain about the tea
              stall giving plain tea and not masala tea. Want to know about the
              real hue of sadness… ask the girls father about his loss. Ask the
              girls brother about the loss of his favourite companion. But still
              no one knows the background details. All they care about is …. I
              don’t know, everything except the feeling of loss which the family
              faces…
            </p>

            <p style={pstyle}>
              Now comes the real suffering of a girl in her life. Adjusting to a
              new family. Always depending on her husband for every single
              thing. Making her new in-laws as her parents. Some who have not
              experienced this would feel this would be a piece of cake. They
              would feel that it would be so exciting for a change like that.
              But wait. One question. Okay, lets take a different approach this
              time. Let’s see this topic in other way. Think that you bought a
              new phone. Will you adapt to it in the first go? Will you not be
              annoyed by the way it works and you have to change the way you
              work for the new phone you bought? If the answer is no, I can
              change however it is, then I suppose that you should be awarded a
              trophy for the way you adjust. But if the answer is yes, it is
              hard to adjust in the start then here you go. If you feel
              adjusting with a new phone is tough then how do you expect that a
              girl who left her house, her parents, her room, her comfort space
              be adjusted in a new family in one day? I know it’s crazy for some
              you guys. You would think all of it is just for writing and
              nothing like this happen in reality. But let me tell you, you
              never know how the food tastes till you eat it yourself…
            </p>

            <p style={pstyle}>
              Now comes the time when she becomes a mother. Then what more life
              do you expect from her. All her time goes by in nurturing her
              children. Giving them the right amount of love and affection. But
              then again, when they do something wrong who is the first person
              who is only person which is blamed?? I hope you got the answer. If
              her child is succeeding it is because of its hard work but if it
              does something wrong why is the first question always raised on a
              mother? Did she tell her child to do something wrong? No answers….
            </p>

            <p style={pstyle}>
              Comes the time where she is left with all the time for herself.
              The time where she did all her responsibilities what she was
              expected to do. But what is the use? Society will still keep
              judging her. Tel her to behave according to her age. Tell her that
              she is not in an age to do stuff which is to be done by
              youngsters. Some cases are even worse. Her child will question
              her. Ask her to adjust her in the way her child wants to live. The
              child never understands that more than half of her entire life she
              has done nothing but adjust to its surrounding people. But if that
              feeling would come, why would there be old age homes and parents
              living in them. They forget the fact that the same mother who
              praised her in every little thing, who supported in everything the
              child ever wanted is not changed. They feel her as a burden. I ask
              what did she do wrong now? Did she not feed you well? Did she not
              love you the way no one else ever loved you in this world? The
              time had not changed. Still she is not having an answer…
            </p>

            <p style={pstyle}>
              Then it is the day she is on her death bed counting on her last
              moments. People say in that situation all the lifetime memories
              flash in front of their eyes. All the happy memories. All the bad
              memories. All the regrets. All of them. But still there she is
              hanging on to all the questions that are never fulfilled. That are
              always going to be there with her after she dies too. She hopes
              that she could find the answers to them once she goes to the god
              after her death. But she is still unsure. Unsure not about the
              existence of god but about the answers she is left to be answered
              with.
            </p>

              So, this were my thoughts on what girls think. Lots of them are
              still uncovered and the questions are unanswered but all we can do
              is make it easier for them to live with unanswered question. In
              this article I have written about girls but I know many boys are
              also going through many problems. I am not telling that all the
              problems are faced by girls but I’m putting the light on the
              problems which usually girls face. I know there are bigger
              problems in the world but why worry about the problems which can’t
              be corrected and think about the problems which can be solved. We
              all wish to have peace in life but ask yourself one question… is
              having peace more peaceful than providing peace to someone else…
